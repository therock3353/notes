Sorting Algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort -> stable
2. Selection Sort -> unstable
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort  -> stable
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort
7. Bucket Sort

Stable Sorting v/s unstable sorting:
    If there are any duplicate numbers then is their order preserved.
    [10, 4, 5*, 100, 5**] => [4, 5*, 5**, 10, 100]
    if the sorting algorithm produces above output then it is considered stable.



Searching Algorithms:
1. Binary Search (Iterative and Recursive)

Needle in a Haystack, find if string A is present in string B.
- KMP Algotithm
- Rabin-Karp


Kadane's Algotithm
